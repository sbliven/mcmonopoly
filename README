Code to calculate steady-state monopoly probabilities.

To run, navigate to this directory in Matlab or Octave and execute

  run MCMonopoly

to build the model and create some graphs. You may want to make graphs
one-at-a-time, taking advantage of the cells (separated by %% comments).

See http://acsweb.ucsd.edu/~sbliven/2012/02/the-statistics-of-monopoly/ for an
explaination of the code.
